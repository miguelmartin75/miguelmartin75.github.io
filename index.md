The name's Martin, Miguel Martin. I'm currently 19 years old. I'm a first year student at [Adelaide Uni](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/) studying [Computer Science (Advanced)](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/2014/bcmsa_bcmpscadv.html). I have a passion for programming, working out, maths, and multimedia (mainly photo/video editing, and 3D modelling).
