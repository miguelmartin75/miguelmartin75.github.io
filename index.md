The name's Martin, Miguel Martin. I'm currently 18 years old. I'm a first year student at the <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/">University of Adelaide</a>
studying <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/2014/bcmsa_bcmpscadv.html">Computer Science (Advanced)</a>. I have a passion for programming,
working out, maths, and multimedia (photo/video editing, 3D modelling, drawing (although not very good at drawing at the moment, but I'm learning!), etc.). 

Check me and my projects out on <a href="https://github.com/miguelmartin75">GitHub</a>.
