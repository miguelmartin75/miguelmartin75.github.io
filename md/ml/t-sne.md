# Summary

- optimization process to preserve clustering properties at lower dimensions
    - minimize objective function which measures discrepancy between discrepancy between similarities in data and similarities in the map
- dimension reduction, done with
    - PCA main concern is squared error (maximize variance), i.e. preserves large pairwise distances.
