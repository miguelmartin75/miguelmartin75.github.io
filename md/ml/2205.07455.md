A summary on procedural learning from NLP perspective

- What is a procedure?
	- Goal (intent, motivation) + steps (events)
	- Arrive at the airport -> TSA -> wait at boarding gate => goal is take a flight
	- Wake up -> play tennis -> make coffee (no goal?)
- Early work is about mining
	- WikiHow mining
	- Linguistic idiosyncrasies
	- Knowledge acquisition and representation
- Early 2010s
	- Deep learning
	- Understanding the procedure
	- Tracking, pre/post condition
	- What if a tool is missing? What if an ingredient is missing?
		- How to deal with that
	- Event prediction
		- Intent reasoning => performing the series of steps => what is my goal?
		- Procedure generation => ask Alexa how to make lasagna
		- Summarization => long article => convert to structured form
- Crawl WikiHow with BFS
- Procedure representation
	- Extract and represent in a structured manner, or
	- Not structured (LLMs are powerful)
- Structured representation
	- Automatically Extracting Procedural Knowledge From Instructional Texts (citation needed)
		- Structure as a knowledge graph
		- Humans hand-crafted the knowledge graph and annotate procedural text from unstructured data
			- Often ends up with incomplete graph with missing entities
- LLMs
	- Cons:
		- No way to verify structures are in-line with what we come up with
- Learning to recognize goals and steps:
	- Goal inference, step inference, step ordering
	- Multiple choice questions scales well
	- Hard negative samples becomes crucial
