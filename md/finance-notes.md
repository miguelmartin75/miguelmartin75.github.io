You have $3,000/year in short-term capital losses to claim. You can deduct this from your capital gains or income for the year and the residual losses can be carried over to the next year. 

**Capital gains can be offset completely with capital losses**

TODO Example with capital losses > gains
- Short-term gain = $0
- Short-term loss = $20k
- Short-term gain = $8k
- Long-term loss = $1.5k
- Losses offset your $9.5k in capital gains and thus you will have no capital gains for the year. Additionally the $10,500 (not correct completely)

Example with capital gains < losses:
- 40k income
- $600 short-term capital gains
- $850 short-term capital loss
- $1025 long-term capital gain
- $7,500 long-term capital loss

Total capital gains (long term + short) = $1,625, which can be offset via your capital losses. $3,000 excess capital loss is deductible against ordinary income for the next year.
