# Exploiting High Quality Datasets
- Can we learn the language of formal logic?
- Can we learn writing formal algorithms?

# Interesting Programming Language Designs / Features

## Machine Learning Applications in PL
- Translation from source -> IR or machine code
- Efficient data structure representations (can we do this with search?)

## JIT + REPL
Implementation:
- LLVM JIT?
	- Con: Need to use LLVM as the IR
- Linker design changes
