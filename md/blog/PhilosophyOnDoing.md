# Introduction
Here is advice I've collected from others and myself over the years, which serves as a set of guidelines when attempting to do "The Thing". The Thing is anything, however this article is biased toward software development, but it does apply to other "Things" in life.

# 1. What Should You Work On?
- Build things for yourself first. Solve problems you personally have day-to-day.
- Research. Understand what came before you, what failed, and what exists.
- Don't worry if someone else has built it. This validates your idea.

# 2. Before Starting
- Ask yourself: why do you want to do it? What value will it bring yourself or others? For example:
	- Are you doing this to solve a problem you have?
	- To educate yourself? If so, what skillset does it help you develop?
- Write down this reason (motivation) to enable you to come back to this written reason when the time is right to start or continue it
- For new ideas:
	- Aim to test it quickly to "eliminate it quickly" - don't treat your idea as precious until you have tested and evaluated its value (see [Jon Carmack's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCBCk4xVa0))
	- [Share the idea with others - don't be fearful of sharing it](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/dont-hide-your-ideas-test-them-anyone-who-will-listen#:~:text=I%20am%20of%20the%20strong,years%20ahead%20of%20everyone%20else)
- To decide on whether you should do the thing:
	- Where does it fit in the [The Eisenhower](https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix) matrix? Is it important? Is it urgent to get done?
	- [Commit yourself to write about it. If you can't commit to writing about it: don't do it.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476249#43478469)

# 3. Starting
- Write about The Thing. Use writing as a tool for thinking and a vetting process for doing The Thing.
- Mindset
	- Commit to The Thing and set your mind to it.
	- Prioritize and focus on one thing at a time.
- Create a Plan
	- Don't detail it too extensively. The first plan should be a high-level outline that you can execute quickly, iterate on, and change at any moment.
	- Ask yourself:
		- What is your MVP? Make sure it provides value.
		- What's the most common use case (this is what is critical)? Start with that.
	- If it's a large Thing, break it down. Work on these small things to evaluate your idea and use it as a potential MVP.
	- Impose constraints. Do it with less. 
		- Set deadlines.
		- Aim and plan to do it faster. If you had 1 month, what would you do? 1 week? 1 day?
		- Remove features.
		- Can you do The Thing with less code?
	- Compounding efforts is ideal (e.g. building independent features that are composed together, code reuse), but don't let planning block you from Doing The Thing.

# Doing The Thing
[Do The Thing](https://x.com/ChrisWillx/status/1664302375656357888?lang=en). [Just do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0). ["Draw and don't waste time"](https://www.apollo-magazine.com/how-to-learn-drawing-from-michelangelo/).
- Process
	- Feedback loops are critical for fast progress. Start small and iterate. 
	- Be willing to adapt and change your plan on the fly.
	- Continue to write about what The Thing is.
	- Document your process whilst doing The Thing.
	- Analyze and document frustrations or inefficiencies with your process.
	- Leverage motivation when it comes and use this momentum to enable you to do more work.
- Mindset
	- Work hard. Being "smart" will come in time.
	- It doesn't have to be perfect. Simplify later.
	- Believe in yourself. Don't undersell yourself or undermine your own abilities.
	- Be specific and decisive.
- Traps
	- Don't over think it (analysis paralysis).
	- Don't under think it, i.e. think before you do. Don't "spin your wheels" on something insignificant or not leading toward your goal.
	- Don't keep your head in the sand. "Look up" and "zoom out" to see the big picture.
	- Don't [pre-maturely abstract](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureAbstraction) ([YAGNI](https://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt)). Specialization often imposes constraints which often enables simplification and optimization. Building something that solves everything often does not work as well as something that is built for the task.

# 4. Marking the Thing as Complete
i.e. Moving onto the Next Thing
- Again, it doesn't have to be perfect.
- Simplify before moving on if you can.
- If you tested your idea and it doesn't work:
	- Analyze why the idea didn't work: was it due to execution?
	- Move on to the next Thing.
