        Hi, I'm Miguel, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco with
        expertise in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Processing &
        Analysis, and Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>
        I've worked at Meta and Microsoft on projects such as <a
        href="">Ego-Exo4D</a>, <a href="">Ego4D</a>, and <a href="">Captum</a>.
        <!-- TODO Checkout my <a href="/projects">personal projects</a>.-->

        <p>
        I earned a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) with Honours from the University of Adelaide. I was born in Australia and grew up in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whyalla">Whyalla</a>, a small town in South Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love reading papers, experimenting with ML models, exploring
        programming languages & compilers, computer graphics, and tinkering
        with computer hardware. Outside of tech, I am passionate about cooking,
        photography, and drawing.
