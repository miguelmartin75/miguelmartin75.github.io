        Hi, I'm Miguel, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco with
        expertise in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Processing &
        Analysis, and Web Development.
        </p>

        I've worked at Meta and Microsoft on projects such as <a

        href="https://ego4d-data.org/">Ego4D</a>, and <a

        <p>
        I earned a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) with Honours from The University of Adelaide. I was born in Australia and grew up in <a

        </p>
        <p>
        I love reading papers, experimenting with ML models, exploring
        programming languages & compilers, computer graphics, and tinkering
        with computer hardware. Outside of tech, I am passionate about cooking,
        photography, and drawing.
