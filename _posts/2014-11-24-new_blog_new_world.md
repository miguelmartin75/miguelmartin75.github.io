This will be my new blogging area. I've moved away from my WordPress blog
and moved to my website, which is hosted by GitHub pages using Jekyll. Now
I can write my posts with markdown in my favourite editor: Vim! Yay. I'll
eventually be deleting my old WordPress blog, but hopefully now I'll be a bit
more active with blogging, but we'll see...
