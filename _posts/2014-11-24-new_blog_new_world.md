This will be my new blogging area. I've moved away from my WordPress blog
and moved to my website, which is hosted by GitHub pages using Jekyll. Soon 
I'll be deleting my old WordPress blog. So watch out world!

The reason I switched from WordPress to GitHub Pages with Jekyll is mainly
due to:

# Styles
I can have custom styles without paying a thing! For example, I finally have 
syntax highlighting (which is in-built to Jekyll) with custom styles, for example:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    std::cout << "Hello highlighted world!\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Integration of blog and website
I was already using GitHub Pages to host my website in the first place,
so I thought integrating my blog to my website would play nicely.

# Vim and Markdown
I can finally write my posts, in Markdown, within my favourite editor: Vim! Yay!
