<p>Here is advice I&apos;ve collected from others and myself over the years, which serves as a set of guidelines when attempting to do &quot;The Thing&quot;. The Thing is anything, however this article is biased toward software development, but it does apply to other &quot;Things&quot; in life.</p>
<h1 id="what-should-you-work-on">
  <a href="#what-should-you-work-on">1. What Should You Work On?</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Build things for yourself first. Solve problems you personally have day-to-day.</li>
<li>Research. Understand what came before you, what failed, and what exists.</li>
<li>Don&apos;t worry if someone else has built it. This validates your idea.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="before-starting">
  <a href="#before-starting">2. Before Starting</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ask yourself: why do you want to do it? What value will it bring yourself or others? For example:<ul>
<li>Are you doing this to solve a problem you have?</li>
<li>To educate yourself? If so, what skillset does it help you develop?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write down this reason (motivation) to enable you to come back to this written reason when the time is right to start or continue it</li>
<li>For new ideas:<ul>
<li>Aim to test it quickly to &quot;eliminate it quickly&quot; - don&apos;t treat your idea as precious until you have tested and evaluated its value (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCBCk4xVa0">Jon Carmack&apos;s talk</a>)</li>
<li>  <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/dont-hide-your-ideas-test-them-anyone-who-will-listen#:~:text=I%20am%20of%20the%20strong,years%20ahead%20of%20everyone%20else">Share the idea with others - don&apos;t be fearful of sharing it</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To decide on whether you should do the thing:<ul>
<li>Where does it fit in the <a href="https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower</a> matrix? Is it important? Is it urgent to get done?</li>
<li>  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476249#43478469">Commit yourself to write about it. If you can&apos;t commit to writing about it: don&apos;t do it.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="starting">
  <a href="#starting">3. Starting</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Write about The Thing. Use writing as a tool for thinking and a vetting process for doing The Thing.</li>
<li>Mindset<ul>
<li>Commit to The Thing and set your mind to it.</li>
<li>Prioritize and focus on one thing at a time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a Plan<ul>
<li>Don&apos;t detail it too extensively. The first plan should be a high-level outline that you can execute quickly, iterate on, and change at any moment.</li>
<li>Ask yourself:<ul>
<li>What is your MVP? Make sure it provides value.</li>
<li>What&apos;s the most common use case (this is what is critical)? Start with that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it&apos;s a large Thing, break it down. Work on these small things to evaluate your idea and use it as a potential MVP.</li>
<li>Impose constraints. Do it with less.<ul>
<li>Set deadlines.</li>
<li>Aim and plan to do it faster. If you had 1 month, what would you do? 1 week? 1 day?</li>
<li>Remove features.</li>
<li>Can you do The Thing with less code?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compounding efforts is ideal (e.g. building independent features that are composed together, code reuse), but don&apos;t let planning block you from Doing The Thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h1>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ChrisWillx/status/1664302375656357888?lang=en">Do The Thing</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0">Just do it</a>. <a href="https://www.apollo-magazine.com/how-to-learn-drawing-from-michelangelo/">&quot;Draw and don&apos;t waste time&quot;</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Process<ul>
<li>Feedback loops are critical for fast progress. Start small and iterate.</li>
<li>Be willing to adapt and change your plan on the fly.</li>
<li>Continue to write about what The Thing is.</li>
<li>Document your process whilst doing The Thing.</li>
<li>Analyze and document frustrations or inefficiencies with your process.</li>
<li>Leverage motivation when it comes and use this momentum to enable you to do more work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mindset<ul>
<li>Work hard. Being &quot;smart&quot; will come in time.</li>
<li>It doesn&apos;t have to be perfect. Simplify later.</li>
<li>Believe in yourself. Don&apos;t undersell yourself or undermine your own abilities.</li>
<li>Be specific and decisive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traps<ul>
<li>Don&apos;t over think it (analysis paralysis).</li>
<li>Don&apos;t under think it, i.e. think before you do. Don&apos;t &quot;spin your wheels&quot; on something insignificant or not leading toward your goal.</li>
<li>Don&apos;t keep your head in the sand. &quot;Look up&quot; and &quot;zoom out&quot; to see the big picture.</li>
<li>Don&apos;t <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureAbstraction">pre-maturely abstract</a> (<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">YAGNI</a>). Specialization often imposes constraints which often enables simplification and optimization. Building something that solves everything often does not work as well as something that is built for the task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <a href="#marking-the-thing-as-complete">4. Marking the Thing as Complete</a>
</h1>
<p>i.e. Moving onto the Next Thing</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, it doesn&apos;t have to be perfect.</li>
<li>Simplify before moving on if you can.</li>
<li>If you tested your idea and it doesn&apos;t work:<ul>
<li>Analyze why the idea didn&apos;t work: was it due to execution?</li>
<li>Move on to the next Thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
