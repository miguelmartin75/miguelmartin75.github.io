- Bowl
  - It's size determines how much air mixes with the wine
  - In general:
    - more tannic, alcoholic or flavourful => wider bowl is better
      - More surface area on the wine = more oxygen
    - full / refreshing => narrow bowl is better
      - Glasses for reds typically larger than for white
- Rim
  - Narrow rim focuses aromas
    - Good for Pinot
    - Accentuates: acidity / sourness, tanins (grippiness)
    - Too tight of a rim can make wine taste harsh or bitter
- Stem
  - Long enough to hold without touching the bowl
  - Longer stems more fragile
