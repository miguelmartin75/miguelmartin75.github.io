How to differentiate depression & burnout? Cynicism.

What are your values?

Factors:
1. Values aren't aligned
2. Overworked
3. Isolated
4. Not rewarded
5. Lack of control
6. Ego - is this coming from you?

Symptoms
1. Lack of energy
2. Lack of emphathy
3. Lack of fulfillment

=> Leads to cynicism

When your values don't align, you will potentially burn out if being overworked/told to work more. For example: if someone is in medicine to help patients over money. If they're asked to stay longer to help more people => fine. If they're instead asked to stay longer to file bills or talk to insurance companies => "go fuck yourself".
