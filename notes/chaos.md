One consistent problem I have in my life is focus. 

I have a lot of ideas and thoughts in my head at once. How do I filter them? How
do I focus? How do I keep calm and not overwhelm myself? How do I get things
done?

- Lack of consistency
- Perfectionism
- Overwhelm
- The feeling of I can always do better or more
- Social Anxiety
- Focus
- Getting Things Done


I have a lot of ideas. How do I execute on one?

How do I prioritize specific ideas? What are the dimensions? What is the value I
am obtaining out of it? How can I quantify the execution of said idea.

Axes:

- Alignment to work
- Personal gain / interest
- Skill useful for the future
